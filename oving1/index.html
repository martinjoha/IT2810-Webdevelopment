      <h3>Dalvasor Sali's "Chaos In symmetry"</h3>
      <p>
        Dalvasor Sali is revolutionary artist from Spain whose general idea is that the viewer of the art should have as much freedom as possible when viewing his artwork.
        What he means by that, is that he provides the structures and general idea, but the viewer should be able to capture the color combination that they want.
        He also focuses a lot on the shapes that he creates, so that they have some sort of unchaotic feel to it. The artwork above, everything is symmetrical, but when you
        add the colors to it, you add the chaotic element to it. And that's what Dalvasor Sali's art is all about.

      <h3>CSS Grid vs. Flexbox</h3>
      <p>
        When designing a website, a useful tool for structuring the overall layout of the page are grids. Grids are a way to partition the page
        into different blocks.This way you can assign different parts of the HTML to a specific block(s) of the page. Two ways of doing this is
        by using CSS Grid and/or CSS Flexbox. CSS Grid creates a two dimensional Grid with both rows and columns. You can also decide what size
        each row and column is, or if you want to adjust itself, it can also do that. A Flexbox is a one dimensional grid where you control only
        one row ore one column. A flexbox makes it easier to control the elements inside the row or column, such as deciding where to align the content, start,
        end or stretch out the entire row. In short, a Flexox is used when you only care about row <i>or</i> color, whereas a Grid is used when you care about both.
        <br /><br /> For my page, I have created a 2x2 grid, where the title row is a flexbox spanning both columns, and the menu is also a flexbox inside the first
        column in the second row. This made it relatively ease to control the elements inside each of the grid items.
      </p>
      <h3>HTML canvas & SVG </h3>
      <p>
        Scalable Vector Graphics(SVG) and canvas are two ways in HTML to create graphics and visual objects in HTML. A canvas is basically like a real life canvas
        where you can draw a line with a certain thickness, and then the canvas has no knowledge of what you drew or what exists in it. If you want the ability to
        change the canvas in any way, you have to keep track of the shapes in a separate script. In SVG, however, you can keep track of all the objects you have
        in your graphic, and make references to them in an easy way. It does not require any Javascript to change it, so you can more easily add interactivity.
        Because of this, scaling the graphic is very easy compared to a canvas. A disadvantage with SVG is that it does not do very well when you have a lot of elements,
        as you have to keep track of all the elements in memory, whereas with a canvas you do not.
      </p>
      <h3>jQuery</h3>
      <p>
        jQuery is a popular and useful framework built for JavaScript. jQuery makes it quicker and easier to build JavaScript webpages and web applications.
        Look at jQuery as a function rather than a language. These functions include; adding animated effects to elements, manipulating the Document Object Model(DOM), and much more!
        jQuery makes it really easy to write JavaScript compatible with several different browsers. The usual incompatibilities you could experience between popular browsers, which
        meant that you often had to write different chunks of JavaScript code for each browser, is non-existent using jQuery. Just call the appropriate jQuery function and jQuery will
        make sure the code runs on the current browser.<br /><br />For my application I used jQuery for all the different buttons' funcitonality, as well as changing the styling when I felt
        it made sense to improve the overall look of the page and its functionality.
      </p>
      <h3>Cross browser testing</h3>
      <p>
        Cross browser testing is the practice of testing your web application in different browser. This includes comparing the appearance
        of the application in the different browsers, as well as the functionality differences in the browsers. This is extremely important
        as there are many different browsers, that also behave differently. When testing my own application on Chrome, Safari and Firefox,
        i observed that the color picker input was different in all the browsers. In Chrome you can change the colors once you move the pointer,
        but in Firefox you had to exit the input window. In Safari there is no input window at all, but there is an input window containing hexadecimal
        values for the color that is currently picked. Other than the color picker differnce, the application looked and worked similarly in the browsers.
